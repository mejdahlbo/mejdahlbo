<br><br>
I come from a strong customer service background, where I've honed my problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of how to assist and educate others.
Now, I'm channeling that experience into cybersecurity, driven by a passion to help, protect, and educate people against cyber threats. 

## Objective
After spending many years in customer service, where I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and analytical skills,
I'm now focused on transitioning into the cybersecurity field.

I'm currently building projects and expanding my knowledge in areas like network security, ethical hacking, and threat analysis.

Specifically I am aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me as I continue this exciting journey!
